## Resource Allocation

### Development Team:
- 1 Full-stack Developer (100% allocation)
- 1 Azure/Cloud Specialist (50% allocation)
- 1 UI/UX Designer (25% allocation)

### Azure Resources:
- Azure Function App (Consumption Plan)
- Azure OpenAI Service
- Azure Storage Account

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Risks:
1. **API Extraction Complexity**
   - **Risk Level:** High
   - **Mitigation:** Start with well-documented APIs and common frameworks, gradually expand support

2. **Azure OpenAI Integration**
   - **Risk Level:** Medium
   - **Mitigation:** Develop fallback mechanisms for when AI assistance is not available

3. **MCP Tool Generation Accuracy**
   - **Risk Level:** High
   - **Mitigation:** Implement thorough validation and testing, start with simple workflows

4. **Performance Issues**
   - **Risk Level:** Medium
   - **Mitigation:** Implement pagination and chunking for large repositories, optimize code generation

## Success Criteria

The POC will be considered successful if it can:

1. Extract REST APIs from at least 3 different types of GitHub repositories
2. Allow users to create simple sequential workflows with the Canvas UI
3. Generate functional MCP tools from the workflows
4. Successfully test the generated MCP tools
5. Demonstrate the end-to-end process from GitHub URL to working MCP tool

## Future Enhancements (Post-POC)

1. Support for GraphQL APIs
2. Advanced workflow features (conditionals, loops, error handling)
3. Authentication and security enhancements
4. Workflow templates and sharing
5. Integration with additional API sources beyond GitHub
6. Performance optimizations for large repositories
7. Enhanced UI with more configuration options
8. Support for custom transformations between API calls
